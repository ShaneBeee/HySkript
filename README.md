Skript but for Hytale.

More info coming soon.
This project is currently a work in progress.

## Building:
If you're looking to build this project, you'll need to update the location of the Hytale server to the location on your computer.  
That can be found in the [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/SkriptDev/HySkript/blob/81ae10ef05527033ff1554b9608788d196b63719/build.gradle.kts#L19) file.  
As of writing this, the Hytale server jar is not yet on Maven Central and will require you to have it on your computer.

To build run `./gradlew build`
